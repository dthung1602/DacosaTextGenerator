# Dacosa Text Generator

## Installation

First we need to install `pdftotext` dependencies. 

On Debian, Ubuntu & friends:

```shell script
sudo apt install build-essential libpoppler-cpp-dev pkg-config python3-dev
``` 

For other platforms, please follow the official guild [here](https://pypi.org/project/pdftotext/)

Now we can proceed to install pip packages:

```shell script
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure that you have proper GPU drivers and `CUDA toolkit` installed.
